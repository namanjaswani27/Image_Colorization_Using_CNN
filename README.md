# Image_Colorization_Using_CNN

# Objective
Given a Grey-Scale Image, predict its colored version

# Approach
We use a U-Net kind of architecture where we feed Grey-Scale Image as Input, and generate AB Channel as output. Final Predicted image is concatenation of output AB channels and input grey-scale image.
